I am a soon-to-be graduate who received my B.S. and M.S. in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in Robotics & Controls at Northwestern University. My interests lie in aligning my experience in robotics with my passion for health & fitness through the development of surgical robotic platforms. I seek to be a positive figure and fellow advocate for women in STEM, and hope to pave the way for those who come after me.

During my time at Northwestern University, I've had the pleasure to take on a variety of projects. From manipulator arms to differential drive robots to swarm systems and more, I've built a robust and exciting toolset of skills. Most of my work focuses on implementing high-level control through the use of ROS and C++ programming.

Aside from my academics, some of my greatest passions in life are health, fitness, and wellbeing. In my freetime, I dive deep into training powerlifting, gymnastics rings, hand balancing, and mobility. As a Chicagoan at heart, I enjoy rollerblading with my dog along the lake, shopping on Michigan Avenue, and exploring different cuisines in the heart of the city. And if you were to ever ask me for a book recommendation, I would send Sonja Lyubomirsky's *The How of Happiness* your way.
