Simultaneous Localization and Mapping is a method of building a map of an unknown world. This project implements **Extended Kalman Filter SLAM** on a differential drive robot made by ROBOTIS known as the Turtlebot. Built entirely from the bottom-up, this project covers a broad range of areas in robotic software development.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a simulated world and allow the Turtlebot to navigate freely (controlled by the user) in order to build a map of its surroundings.

## Hardware and Software Requirements

## Feature Detection

## Extended Kalman Filter

## Data Association
