## Sherman
When I was a sophomore in college, I adopted a puppy, Sherman, who soon became my dearest best friend. In our free time, we enjoy rollerbloading along the lakefill or going on long walks in the city. This little guy goes everywhere with me, from the rocky mountains to the east coast marinas and everywhere in between.

## Fitness
In high school, I was introduced to the sport of powerlifting. Ever since, fitness has been immersed in every single aspect of my life. Keeping my mind and body stimulated has not only lead to a healthy lifestyle, but also an unparalleled boost in confidence and resilience.

## Travel
I've been fortunate enough to be able to explore the world with my family and friends. A few of my favorite trips include surfing the shores of La Jolla, skiing the mountains of Breckenridge, jumping cliffs in Alabama, and wandering the lively streets of New York City.
